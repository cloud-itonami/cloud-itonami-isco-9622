# cloud-itonami-isco-9622

Open Occupation Blueprint for **ISCO-08 9622**: Odd-job Persons.

This repository designs a forkable OSS business for an independent handyman/odd-job practice: a general repair-support robot performs material handling and cleanup tasks under a governor-gated actor, so the practice keeps its own service records instead of renting a closed field-service SaaS.

## Robotics premise

All cloud-itonami verticals are designed on the premise that a **robot performs
the physical domain work**. Here a general repair-support robot performs material handling, minor assembly and cleanup tasks under an actor that proposes
actions and an independent **Handyman Governor** that gates them. The governor never
dispatches hardware itself; `:high`/`:safety-critical` actions (such as
operating near electrical/plumbing systems, or working at height) require human sign-off.

A live sample of the operator console (robotics safety console, shared template) is rendered in [docs/samples/operator-console.html](docs/samples/operator-console.html) — pure-data HTML output of `kotoba.robotics.ui`.

## Core Contract

```text
service request + task scope + site access
        |
        v
Handyman Advisor -> Handyman Governor -> repair-support, or human sign-off
        |
        v
robot actions (gated) + operating records + audit ledger
```

No automated advice can dispatch a robot action the governor refuses, suppress
an operating record, or disclose sensitive data without governor approval and
audit evidence.
